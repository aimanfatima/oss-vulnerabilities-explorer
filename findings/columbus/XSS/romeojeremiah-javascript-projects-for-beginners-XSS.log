	Vulnerable Pattern: eval(
	Attack Description: eval() executes strings as JavaScript code, making it highly susceptible to code injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
//display property
//onclick event
//eval() function
//assignment operator
//



Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
//display property
//onclick event
//eval() function
//assignment operator
//



			2. An attacker could inject a malicious script where the `eval(` pattern is used, exploiting this specific function in the code.
			3. For instance, an attacker might craft a payload like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which would get injected here:
//display property
//onclick event
//eval('<script>alert("XSS")</script>',) function
//assignment operator
//



			4. When the browser renders this code, the malicious script executes, leading to an XSS attack.
