	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
                for child in item['folder']['children']:

                    # check etag if child is a folder and force-dirs is true or if child is not a folder
                    if (child['itemType'] == 32 and not args.force_dirs) or child['itemType'] != 32:
                        # check if local copy is up to date
                        cur.execute('SELECT etag FROM download WHERE id = ?', (child['id'],))
                        rows = cur.fetchall()
                        if len(rows) == 1 and rows[0][0] == child['eTag']:
                            continue

                    # if folder
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
                for child in item['folder']['children']:

                    # check etag if child is a folder and force-dirs is true or if child is not a folder
                    if (child['itemType'] == 32 and not args.force_dirs) or child['itemType'] != 32:
                        # check if local copy is up to date
                        cur.execute('SELECT etag FROM download WHERE id = ?', (child['id'],))
                        rows = cur.fetchall()
                        if len(rows) == 1 and rows[0][0] == child['eTag']:
                            continue

                    # if folder
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_id = "123"

    Malicious input that could expose all users:
    user_id = "123 OR 1=1"

    Resulting query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 OR 1=1
    # This would return all users instead of just user 123
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
