	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
    loincgrep_c = '^LOINC:([0-9]{4,5}-[0-9])$'
    

    # DONE (ticket #1): instead of relying on sqlite_denorm.sql, create the df_joinme table from inside this 
    # script by putting the appropriate SQL commands into character strings and then passing those
    # strings as arguments to execute() (see below for an example of cur.execute() usage (cur just happens 
    # to be what we named the cursor object we created above, and execute() is a method that cursor objects have)
    # DONE: create an id to concept_cd mapping table (and filtering out redundant facts taken care of here)
    # TODO: parameterize the fact-filtering

    # Variable persistence not fully implemented and this implementation might 
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
    loincgrep_c = '^LOINC:([0-9]{4,5}-[0-9])$'
    

    # DONE (ticket #1): instead of relying on sqlite_denorm.sql, create the df_joinme table from inside this 
    # script by putting the appropriate SQL commands into character strings and then passing those
    # strings as arguments to execute() (see below for an example of cur.execute() usage (cur just happens 
    # to be what we named the cursor object we created above, and execute() is a method that cursor objects have)
    # DONE: create an id to concept_cd mapping table (and filtering out redundant facts taken care of here)
    # TODO: parameterize the fact-filtering

			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
