	Vulnerable Pattern: .format(
	Attack Description: Using .format() for SQL queries can be vulnerable to SQL injection if user input is not properly sanitized.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:

original_current_directory = os.getcwd()

default_encoding = sys.getdefaultencoding()
filename_decode_warning = "Warning: ignoring filename that couldn't be decoded"
filename_decode_warning += " with {}:".format(default_encoding)

usage_message = '''Usage: %prog [OPTIONS] COMMAND

COMMAND must be one of:

Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:

original_current_directory = os.getcwd()

default_encoding = sys.getdefaultencoding()
filename_decode_warning = "Warning: ignoring filename that couldn't be decoded"
filename_decode_warning += " with {}:".format(default_encoding)

usage_message = '''Usage: %prog [OPTIONS] COMMAND

COMMAND must be one of:

			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `.format(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
