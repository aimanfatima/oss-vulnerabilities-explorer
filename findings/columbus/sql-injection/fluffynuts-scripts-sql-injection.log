	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:

ttstart = utctime(start)
ttcend = utctime(now)

conn = sqlite3.connect("/opt/ham/nea.db")
c = conn.execute("select oidid, value, created from tbldata where oidid in (1,2) order by oidid, created asc")

totals = dict()
totals[1] = 0
totals[2] = 0
last_val = 0.0
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:

ttstart = utctime(start)
ttcend = utctime(now)

conn = sqlite3.connect("/opt/ham/nea.db")
c = conn.execute("select oidid, value, created from tbldata where oidid in (1,2) order by oidid, created asc")

totals = dict()
totals[1] = 0
totals[2] = 0
last_val = 0.0
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_id = "123"

    Malicious input that could expose all users:
    user_id = "123 OR 1=1"

    Resulting query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 OR 1=1
    # This would return all users instead of just user 123
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
