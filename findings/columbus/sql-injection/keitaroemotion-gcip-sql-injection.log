	Vulnerable Pattern: .format(
	Attack Description: Using .format() for SQL queries can be vulnerable to SQL injection if user input is not properly sanitized.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
since    = [x for x in args if x.startswith("--since=")]
since    = since[0] if len(since) > 0 else ''
ssh_user = [x for x in args if x.startswith("-u=")]
ssh_host = [x for x in args if x.startswith("-h=")]
ssh_key  = [x for x in args if x.startswith("-k=")]
res      = os.popen("git --no-pager log {}".format(since)).read()

commits = []
commit  = []
hash    = ""
date    = ""
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
since    = [x for x in args if x.startswith("--since=")]
since    = since[0] if len(since) > 0 else ''
ssh_user = [x for x in args if x.startswith("-u=")]
ssh_host = [x for x in args if x.startswith("-h=")]
ssh_key  = [x for x in args if x.startswith("-k=")]
res      = os.popen("git --no-pager log {}".format(since)).read()

commits = []
commit  = []
hash    = ""
date    = ""
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `.format(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
