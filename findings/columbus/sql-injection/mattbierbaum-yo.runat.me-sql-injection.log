	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
def connect_db():
    return sqlite3.connect(DATABASE)

def get_used_words():
    with connect_db() as db:
        words = set(db.execute('SELECT nickname from urls').fetchall())
    return words.union(SPECIAL)

def get_random_noun():
    with open('words.pickle') as f:
        words = pickle.load(f)
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
def connect_db():
    return sqlite3.connect(DATABASE)

def get_used_words():
    with connect_db() as db:
        words = set(db.execute('SELECT nickname from urls').fetchall())
    return words.union(SPECIAL)

def get_random_noun():
    with open('words.pickle') as f:
        words = pickle.load(f)
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_id = "123"

    Malicious input that could expose all users:
    user_id = "123 OR 1=1"

    Resulting query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 OR 1=1
    # This would return all users instead of just user 123
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
