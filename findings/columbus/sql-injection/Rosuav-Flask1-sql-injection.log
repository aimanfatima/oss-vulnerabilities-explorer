	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
	more = 'more' in request.args # We don't care what its value is - it might even be blank
	if 'recent' in request.args: query += " order by id desc"
	else: query += " order by date desc, id desc"
	if not more: query += " limit 51"
	cur = db.cursor()
	cur.execute(query, params)
	rows = cur.fetchall()
	morelink = ""
	if not more and len(rows)>50:
		rows.pop() # Discard the last row. We only care that it's present (and therefore we need a "More" link)
		search = "" # ?search
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
	more = 'more' in request.args # We don't care what its value is - it might even be blank
	if 'recent' in request.args: query += " order by id desc"
	else: query += " order by date desc, id desc"
	if not more: query += " limit 51"
	cur = db.cursor()
	cur.execute(query, params)
	rows = cur.fetchall()
	morelink = ""
	if not more and len(rows)>50:
		rows.pop() # Discard the last row. We only care that it's present (and therefore we need a "More" link)
		search = "" # ?search
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
