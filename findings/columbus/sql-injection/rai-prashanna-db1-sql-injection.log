	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# This section is for updating discount when the ProductID is provided.
productID = input ("enter product ID: ")

mycursor.execute("SELECT pID,discount from Product where pID="+productID)

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()
print("Product  \t Discount")
for row in myresult:
  print(str(row[0])+"\t\t\t"+str(row[1]))
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
mycursor = mydb.cursor()

# This section is for updating discount when the ProductID is provided.
productID = input ("enter product ID: ")

mycursor.execute("SELECT pID,discount from Product where pID="+productID)

myresult = mycursor.fetchall()
print("Product  \t Discount")
for row in myresult:
  print(str(row[0])+"\t\t\t"+str(row[1]))
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_id = "123"

    Malicious input that could expose all users:
    user_id = "123 OR 1=1"

    Resulting query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 OR 1=1
    # This would return all users instead of just user 123
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
