	Vulnerable Pattern: .format(
	Attack Description: Using .format() for SQL queries can be vulnerable to SQL injection if user input is not properly sanitized.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
	total_blocks = 0
	i = 0

	for fn in args.files:
		if args.verbose:
			print( "Input: {}".format(fn), file=sys.stderr )
		finfo = os.stat(fn)

		# If we have a device the size is 0 so try and seek to find the real file size
		if finfo.st_size==0:
			tmp=open(fn,'rb')
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
	total_blocks = 0
	i = 0

	for fn in args.files:
		if args.verbose:
			print( "Input: {}".format(fn), file=sys.stderr )
		finfo = os.stat(fn)

		# If we have a device the size is 0 so try and seek to find the real file size
		if finfo.st_size==0:
			tmp=open(fn,'rb')
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `.format(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
