	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
            sys.exit(1)

Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
            sys.exit(1)

    def showTables(self,cursor,like_statment=False):
        if not like_statment:
            try:
                cursor.execute("SHOW TABLES")
                for row in cursor.fetchall():
                    print row[0]
            except MySQLdb.Error, e:
                print e[1],"\nError code: "+str(e[0])
        if like_statment:
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
