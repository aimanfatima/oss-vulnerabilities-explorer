	Vulnerable Pattern: .format(
	Attack Description: Using .format() for SQL queries can be vulnerable to SQL injection if user input is not properly sanitized.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
        if type(address) == str:
            self.address = address
        elif type(address) == int:
            self.address = str(address)
        elif type(address) == tuple:
            self.address = '{}:{}'.format(*address)

        self.driver = driver

        if type(config) == str:
            self.config = [config]
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
        if type(address) == str:
            self.address = address
        elif type(address) == int:
            self.address = str(address)
        elif type(address) == tuple:
            self.address = '{}:{}'.format(*address)

        self.driver = driver

        if type(config) == str:
            self.config = [config]
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `.format(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
