	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
import sys

def convert(dbname, out=sys.stdout):
    co = sqlite3.connect(dbname)
    cu = co.cursor()
    cu.execute("""select id,year,month,v,f from obs
      where element='tmeanM' order by id,year,month""")
    # *obs* has one row per month, group so that we have
    # all the months for one station--year together.
    for g,rows in itertools.groupby(cu, lambda row: row[:2]):
        id,year = g
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
import sys

def convert(dbname, out=sys.stdout):
    co = sqlite3.connect(dbname)
    cu = co.cursor()
    cu.execute("""select id,year,month,v,f from obs
      where element='tmeanM' order by id,year,month""")
    # *obs* has one row per month, group so that we have
    # all the months for one station--year together.
    for g,rows in itertools.groupby(cu, lambda row: row[:2]):
        id,year = g
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_id = "123"

    Malicious input that could expose all users:
    user_id = "123 OR 1=1"

    Resulting query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 OR 1=1
    # This would return all users instead of just user 123
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
