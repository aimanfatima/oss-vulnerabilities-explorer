	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
conn = connect('errorcode.db')
cur = conn.cursor()

print "[-] Looking for command '%s' (executable '%s') with error %s" %  ( command, executable, errorcode)
print "[-] (this was the last error)"
res = cur.execute('''SELECT explanation FROM errorcodes WHERE command = '%s' AND errorcode = '%s' ''' % ( executable, errorcode) )

print ''
try:
	print "-> %s" % res.fetchone()[0]
except TypeError as te:
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
conn = connect('errorcode.db')
cur = conn.cursor()

print "[-] Looking for command '%s' (executable '%s') with error %s" %  ( command, executable, errorcode)
print "[-] (this was the last error)"
res = cur.execute('''SELECT explanation FROM errorcodes WHERE command = '%s' AND errorcode = '%s' ''' % ( executable, errorcode) )

print ''
try:
	print "-> %s" % res.fetchone()[0]
except TypeError as te:
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_id = "123"

    Malicious input that could expose all users:
    user_id = "123 OR 1=1"

    Resulting query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 OR 1=1
    # This would return all users instead of just user 123
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
