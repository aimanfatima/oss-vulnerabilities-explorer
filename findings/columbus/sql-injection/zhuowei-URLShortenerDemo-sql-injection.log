	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:

conn = sqlite3.connect(PATH_TO_INSTALL + "/c/data/urls.db")

c = conn.cursor();

c.execute("select url from urls where id = ?", (urlid, ));
urldata = c.fetchone();

if urldata == None:
	print_fail()
	exit()
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:

conn = sqlite3.connect(PATH_TO_INSTALL + "/c/data/urls.db")

c = conn.cursor();

c.execute("select url from urls where id = ?", (urlid, ));
urldata = c.fetchone();

if urldata == None:
	print_fail()
	exit()
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_id = "123"

    Malicious input that could expose all users:
    user_id = "123 OR 1=1"

    Resulting query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 OR 1=1
    # This would return all users instead of just user 123
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
