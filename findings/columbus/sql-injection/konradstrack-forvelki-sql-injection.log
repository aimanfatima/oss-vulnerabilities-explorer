	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
	except IOError:
		print>>sys.stderr, "unable to read file %s" % filename
		sys.exit(1)
	else:
		pgm = parser.parse(src)
		for result in pgm.execute():
			print result

Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
	except IOError:
		print>>sys.stderr, "unable to read file %s" % filename
		sys.exit(1)
	else:
		pgm = parser.parse(src)
		for result in pgm.execute():
			print result

def interactive_interpreter():
	ex = executor()
	try:
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
