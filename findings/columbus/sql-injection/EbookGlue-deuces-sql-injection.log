	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
	base_postgres_url = env_var_file.read().strip()
	env_var_file.close()

    engine = sa.create_engine("%s/postgres" % base_postgres_url)
    conn = engine.connect()
    conn.execute("commit")
    return conn

def push_from(db_name):
    conn = connect_to_db()
    result = conn.execute("select oid from pg_database where datname='%s';" % db_name)
Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
	base_postgres_url = env_var_file.read().strip()
	env_var_file.close()

    engine = sa.create_engine("%s/postgres" % base_postgres_url)
    conn = engine.connect()
    conn.execute("commit")
    return conn

def push_from(db_name):
    conn = connect_to_db()
    result = conn.execute("select oid from pg_database where datname='%s';" % db_name)
			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_id = "123"

    Malicious input that could expose all users:
    user_id = "123 OR 1=1"

    Resulting query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 OR 1=1
    # This would return all users instead of just user 123
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
