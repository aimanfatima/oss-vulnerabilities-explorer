	Vulnerable Pattern: % %
	Attack Description: Using % string formatting in SQL queries can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:

Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:

			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `% %` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
