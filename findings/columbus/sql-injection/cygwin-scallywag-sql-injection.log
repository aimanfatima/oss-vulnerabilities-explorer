	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:


def lookup_id(id):
    with contextlib.closing(sqlite3.connect(carpetbag.dbfile)) as conn:
        conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
        cursor = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE id = ?', (id,))
        row = cursor.fetchone()

    if not row:
        sys.exit("job id {} not found".format(id))

Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:


def lookup_id(id):
    with contextlib.closing(sqlite3.connect(carpetbag.dbfile)) as conn:
        conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
        cursor = conn.execute('SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE id = ?', (id,))
        row = cursor.fetchone()

    if not row:
        sys.exit("job id {} not found".format(id))

			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_id = "123"

    Malicious input that could expose all users:
    user_id = "123 OR 1=1"

    Resulting query:
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 OR 1=1
    # This would return all users instead of just user 123
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
