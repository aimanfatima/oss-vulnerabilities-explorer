	Vulnerable Pattern: execute(
	Attack Description: Direct execution of SQL queries with string concatenation can lead to SQL injection.
	Vulnerable Code Snippet:
                break
        except FileNotFoundError:
            pass
        print("\nPWCIW: Hash Changed")
        function()
def execute(command):
    """Function to execute command line commands

    Args:
        command (object): Command

Step-by-Step Attack Scenario:
			1. The vulnerable code is found in the following file:
                break
        except FileNotFoundError:
            pass
        print("\nPWCIW: Hash Changed")
        function()
def execute(command):
    """Function to execute command line commands

    Args:
        command (object): Command

			2. An attacker could inject malicious SQL commands where the `execute(` pattern is used.
			3. For example, an attacker might craft a payload like:
Original intended input:
    user_input = "valid_input"

    Malicious input example:
    user_input = "' OR '1'='1"

    Resulting query transformation:
    Original: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = 'valid_input'
    Malicious: SELECT * FROM table WHERE field = '' OR '1'='1'
    # This would bypass authentication or return all records
			4. When this malicious input is processed, the SQL query structure would be altered, potentially exposing or modifying sensitive data.
